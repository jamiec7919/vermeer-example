# Vermeer Light Tools - Examples

Vermeer Light Tools is an open source 3D graphics rendering package.  Vermeer provides a ray tracing
core, physically plausible shading and deterministic monte-carlo path tracing all
wrapped up into a production renderer.  

The philosophy behind Vermeer is 'physical as possible but the artist is in charge'.  Pragmatic considerations come before physical realism and any attribute may be pushed or pulled beyond the
realms of reality. If it looks right, it IS right.

This repository contains example vnf files and other data.  

Please note some examples require mesh data that has not been included in this repository as I'm unsure
if the individual licenses allow it.  I've included direct links and instructions to download these models in the appropriate .vnf files:

* CornellBox-Sphere.vnf
* teapot.vnf
